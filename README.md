# cst-python-co-simulation
Requirements
We recommend using python3.6 and pycharm.
We recommend resetting a new environment for cst-python-co-simulatioin, eg:python3.6(cst_env)

Create a new system environment variable named PYTHONPATH and set its value to “AMD64\python_cst_libraries” in the CST installation directory

Introduction
The project is mainly used to randomly generate and simulate meta-atoms on demand, and establish datasets that can be used to train and test the neural networks. Also, the metasurface is modeled automatically in cst according to the geometric parameters.
